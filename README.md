# üé¨ Web.MediaBox.Pro üöÄ

**A powerful, private, browser-based media player with game-changing independent volume control.**

</div>

Welcome to **Web.MediaBox.Pro**, a lightweight yet powerful media player designed for the ultimate viewing experience right in your browser. This single-file web application lets you play local video files or stream from the web with a rich set of features that rival native applications‚Äîall without any installation.

The core mission of this app is to solve a common frustration: the inability to control a video's volume independently of your device's main audio. With Web.MediaBox.Pro, you can finally mute your movie while still listening to music or a podcast from another app. It‚Äôs a level of control that standard players simply don't offer.

## ü§î Why Use This App?

> Compared to native apps like VLC or MX Player, Web.MediaBox.Pro's killer feature is its **independent volume control**. While those excellent apps are tied to your system's master "Media Volume," our player exists in its own sandboxed environment, giving you a level of audio freedom that is simply not possible elsewhere.
>
> Without this app, you're left juggling system volumes, unable to multitask your audio, and often missing the advanced features like `.srt` support or audio track selection that make for a truly great viewing experience. This app fills a unique gap, turning your browser into a desktop-class media powerhouse.
